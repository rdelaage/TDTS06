\begin{enumerate}
\item The web browser is running HTTP version 1.1, we can see that at the end of the request line. The Server is also running HTTP 1.1, we can see that at the beginning of the response line. 
\item We can see the accepted languages by looking at the \texttt{Accept-Language} header in the request message, here we see \texttt{Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5}that is meaning that the browser can accept content written in english with a Quality values of 0.5. The browser also privide a \texttt{User-Agent} header indicating the software used to make the request, a \texttt{Accept} header containing a list of accepted mime type and a \texttt{Accept-Encoding} header containing a list of supported encoding (compression) supported.
\item We can see the IP address of each host in the packet information. For example, for the first packet we have \texttt{Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: 192.168.8.248, Dst: 128.119.245.12} meaning that the source has the IP address 192.168.8.248 (a private IP address, behind a NAT) this is the client here, and the destination (the server here) has the IP address \texttt{128.119.245.12}.
\item The returned status code is 200, this is visible on the first line of the response message after the used version of HTTP \texttt{HTTP/1.1 200 OK}. It means that the response from server to the GET request is successful without any problem.
\item The document was last modified on Thursday, 01 September 2022 at 05:58:01 GMT, we can see that in the \texttt{Last-Modified} header of the response message
\item 128 Bytes are returned to the browser, this is visible in the \texttt{Content-Length} header.
\item There is no other header in the raw data that is not displayed in the listening window.
\end{enumerate}

We saw here how a simple HTTP request and response works. We can see the concept of encapsulation (HTTP encapsuled in TCP which is encapsuled in IP which is encapsuled in Ethernet) and the purpose of each layer (ethernet to physically link two devices, IP to route the packet to the destination host and TCP to control the communication). We understand the goal of the HTTP headers, to exchange information about the client (user agent, accepted languages, ...), the server (\texttt{Server} header), how to communicate (\texttt{Upgrade-Insecure-Requests} and \texttt{Connection} headers) and metadata about the returned document (\texttt{Content-Type}, \texttt{Last-Modified} and \texttt{Content-Length} headers). We can also see the standard port of an HTTP server and the port used by the client for the communication in the TCP header \texttt{Transmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 50692, Dst Port: 80, Seq: 1, Ack: 1, Len: 381}, here 80 and 50692 respectively. Moreover TCP headers contain information about the sequence number of the segment and the length of the data.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\item We look at the first request headers in the request message, there is no header \texttt{If-Modified-Since}.
\item For this first request, the server returned explicitely the content of the file, we have the text after the headers.
\item We have a \texttt{If-Modified-Since} header in the second request, the value of this header is \texttt{Thu, 01 Sep 2022 05:59:01 GMT} it corresponds to the \texttt{Last-Modified} header of the first response.
\item The returned HTTP status code is 304 and the phrase is \texttt{Not Modified}, this means the content was not modified since the last fetch. The server did not returned the content explicitely, instead the browser display the cached version of the content since it was not modified.
\end{enumerate}

This experimentation shows us the cache mecanism of HTTP, we need to have a first fetch in order to cache the resource, then the browser can cache it associated to the \texttt{Last-Modified} date given in the response order and for the future requests, the browser can add a \texttt{If-Modified-Since} header with this date to indicate to the server that this version of the resource is cached and there is no need to send it again. The return status will be 304 and not 200 when the browser must use the cached version. This mecanism avoid to transfer a whole document when this is not necessary, this is an optimization.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{11}
\item There is only one GET request, the packet number 24 contains this request message.
\item The packet number 26 contains the status code and phrase of the response, the status code returned is 200 and the phrase OK.
\item 2 TCP segments (26 and 28) were needed in order to receive the response.
\item The HTTP headers were present only in the first TCP packet message, not in the second because HTTP headers, version, code and phrase are part of the HTTP protocole which is encapsuled in the TCP protocol, the segmentation is done by TCP only. The images below show the payload of each TCP packet.
\end{enumerate}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{TCPPayload1}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{TCPPayload2}

In this experimentation we see TCP segmentation in action. If data of response is too long to hold in just one TCP, TCP segmentation happens and TCP segmentations are transferred to client. HTTP doesn't matter about how the message will be transfered to the client. TCP is then able to assemble the entire message in the order as a single HTTP response.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{15}
\item 3 GET requests were sent, two (52 and 56) were sent to the server 128.119.245.12 and one (64) to the server (178.79.137.164)
\item The requests were made in parallel because the request for the second image was made before receiving the response for the first image request.
\end{enumerate}

In this experimentation we learn more about how a browser make different requests for a single web page with embedded media, the browser can download multiple media in parallel to optimize the time needed to display the page to the user, if the first server responds late the user doesn't need to wait before viewing the second image.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{17}
\item The server responds with a 401 status code and Unauthorized phrase to the first request with a \texttt{WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="wireshark-students only"} header, meaning the client has to authentificate.
\item In the second request there is a \texttt{Authorization: Basic d2lyZXNoYXJrLXN0dWRlbnRzOm5ldHdvcms=} header. This is for the HTTP authentification with an base64 encoded \texttt{username:password} couple.
\end{enumerate}

HTTP enable the server to ask for authentification and the client to authentificate thanks to the headers. Whenever client tries out authorization, new HTTP packets are sent to the server to check. We have to be carefull that these informations of authentification are sent as base64 encoded so they are not protected against sniffers, meaning that they can be stolen by a malicious person. That is one of reasons why basic HTTP is not used anymore in some websites.

\chapter{Question 20}

The \texttt{Connection: Keep-Alive} means that the host wants to have a persistant connection to the other host (the TCP socket will not be closed), we should use this header if we know that we will need other requests to the same server. We must use the \texttt{Connection: Close} header when we don't need more requests to free the connection (close the TCP socket).
\end{document}
